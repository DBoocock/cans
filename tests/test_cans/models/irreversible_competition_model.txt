# The "#" character is reserved for comments (Python style).
# Species names may contain alpha-numeric and underscore characters only.

# If specified here (i.e. given numberic values rather than None),
# initial amounts and array-level parameters cannot be changed in the
# resulting roadrunner object. If these are to be inferred then leave
# the values as None.

# All species must by specified an initial numeric value or None. Using
# None creates a global parameter for which it is later possible to
# change the value.
