# If specified here (i.e. given numberic values rather than None),
# initial amounts and global parameters cannot be changed in the resulting
# roadrunner object. If these are parameters to be inferred then leave the
# values as None. Specifying values for local parameters (e.g. b below) here
# would fix the array size and is not currently supported.

@init_amounts
N: None    # Leave as None to create a global paramter.
C: None

@globals
k: None    # Setting a value, rather than leaving as None
	   # would fix the parameter. This is not desired if
	   # wanting to simulate the model with different
	   # parameter values (e.g. when inferring parameters).

@locals
b: None    # Leave as None to create local parameters

@reaction: Growth
# Use SBML Level 3 compatible math (e.g. ^ not **)
C + N -> 2C; b*C*N

# Diffusion from a compartment to a nearest neighbour
# Species in a neighbouring compartment have a perceding underscore after a
# possible stoichiometry (e.g. _N or 2_H20).
@reaction: Diffusion
N <-> _N; k*N - k*_N    # <-> indicates reversibility
